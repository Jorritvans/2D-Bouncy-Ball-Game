    <p>Brick Breaker is a Breakout clone in which the player must smash a wall of bricks by deflecting a
        bouncing ball with a paddle. The paddle may move horizontally and is controlled with
        the computer's mouse or the touch of a finger in the case of touchscreen. When all the bricks have
        been destroyed, the player advances to a new level. There are multiple levels and here are many versions of
        brick
        breaker, some in which you can shoot flaming fireballs or play with more than one ball if the player gets a
        power up.</p>

    <p>This game has got multiple levels.<br>
        it can be paused using the "p" key.<br>
        If the ball moves under the moving paddle you will lose a life.<br>
        If you are able to eliminate all the blocks without the ball going under the paddle you will advance to a new
        level!<br>
        On a new and harder level the number of lives will increase to give you a better chance at completing the
        game!<br><br>
        <i>Hope you enjoy!!!</i>
